{"name":"Jquery-waitfor","tagline":"A jQuery plugin that polls for one or more asynchronous DOM elements","body":"### Reliably wait for one or more async DOM elements.\r\njQuery.waitFor is actually a static method that is added to the jQuery prototype object (jQuery.fn). It will poll for one or more asynchronous DOM elements. You can specify a callback that executes when all the async DOM elements are found, or a failure callback that executes when polling fails.\r\n\r\n### Waiting for one element\r\n\r\nPass a string containing the CSS selector of the element that you want to wait for. jQuery.waitFor will always return a jQuery deferred, so you simply chain a call to the .done() method, and pass that method a named or anonymous function.\r\n\r\n```\r\njQuery.waitFor('#someElementId').done(function(){\r\n  alert('The element I was wating for is in the DOM!');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Waiting for multiple elements\r\n\r\nPass an array containing strings of CSS selectors for each element that you want to wait for. jQuery.waitFor's return value (a jQuery deferred) will resolve when ALL of the elements are found in the DOM.\r\n\r\n```\r\njQuery.waitFor(['#firstElement','#secondElement','#thirdElement']).done(function(){\r\n  alert('All of the elements that I was wating for are in the DOM!');\r\n});\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
